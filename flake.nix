    # package is used so different computers can fetch the right package.

    # library accessable to others who reference your flake.

    # attribute to give you access to all your modules anwhere.

      default = { imports = listFilesRecursive ./modules; };

    #====<< Overlays >>========================================================>
    # Overlays are perhaps the most powerful feature Nix has. You can use them
    # to overlay overrides to existing packages in the with custom options. This
    # alloes you to apply your own patches or build flags with out needing to
    # maintain a fork of nixpkgs or adding a third party repository.

    #====<< Nix Development Shells >>==========================================>
    # Development shells `nix develop` are ephemeral environments where you can
    # get access to packages that are only available in the initialized shell
    # (like `nix shell`), but here you can go through execution stages manually
    # to better test and verify packages. Packages from dev shells are also
    # cached after initialization so that later calls are instant.

    let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; }; in

      // { default = import ./shells/isoShell.nix { inherit pkgs; }; }
    );

    #====<< Packages >>========================================================>
    # Here is where you define your custom packages. You can package anything
    # you want, but should only keep personal packages in this repository as it
    # is better to keep papackages you want to be publicaly accessable in a
    # seperate repository and eventually added to the offical nixpkgs repo.
    pkgs = genEachArch (system:
    let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; }; in
      attrsForEach (getBaseFileNames ./packages) (package: {
        ${package} = import ./packages/${package}.nix { inherit pkgs; };
      })
      # Here you can set the default package (built with `nix build`)
      // { default = import ./packages/nix-iso-setup.nix { inherit pkgs; }; }
    );

    #====<< Applications >>====================================================>
    # Applications differ from packages by that they can be started with:
    # `nix run .#<name-of-application>`. As you can only "run" applications,
    # other packages like theme sets or program extensions like plugins cannot
    # be applications. Other than that they are identical.
    apps = genEachArch (system:
    let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; }; in
      attrsForEach (getBaseFileNames ./packages) (package: {
        ${package} = import ./packages/${package}.nix { inherit pkgs; };
      })
      # Here you can set the default package (built with `nix build`)
      // { default = import ./packages/nix-iso-setup.nix { inherit pkgs; }; }
    );

    #====<< Literally Anything >>==============================================>
    # The ouputs set can contain anything you want, the above are just things
    # mapped by the Nix command or just convention (which you should follow!),
    # but if you need some thing else, you can just create an attribute for it.
